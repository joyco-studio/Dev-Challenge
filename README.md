## Challenge Scope

**Figma**: [JOYCO Dev Challenge](<https://www.figma.com/design/yIttBU3vUZilw0OCqsENde/(JOYCO)-Dev-challenge>)

What we’re looking for:

- ♻️ **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**
- 🌐 **Basehub integration** for dynamic content
- 🧩 **Form** with validation and custom error handling:
  - Name (no numbers, max 50 chars)
  - Country (dropdown with preset list)
  - Email (valid format)
  - Store entries in Basehub

> ✍️ We already left the form schema and submission endpoint ready to plug in — no need to overthink the backend. Just wire it up and style it your way.

- 🔍 **Pixel-perfect** design match
- 📱 **Responsive layouts** for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
  (fixed font sizes per breakpoint)
- 🖼️ **Retina-ready images** (2x)
- 🎭 **Custom interactions or animations**  
  (Framer Motion, GSAP — up to you)
